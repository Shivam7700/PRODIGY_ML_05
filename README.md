Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a robust model capable of accurately recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content. The model empowers users to track dietary intake, facilitating informed food choices for a healthier lifestyle.

Features:
1.Accurate recognition of various food items.
2.Calorie estimation for each recognized item.
3.Supports informed dietary tracking.

Usage:
1.Clone the repository and install requirements.
2.Open food_recognition_calorie_estimation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3.Train the model and use it to estimate calories from food images.
